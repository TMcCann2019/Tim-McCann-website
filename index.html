            <p>Dog History
                <ol class="Dogs">
                    <li>My first dog I had was named Junie. She was a 1 year old pit-bull mix that I adopted with my significant other.</li>
                    <li>My second dog I got was named Rio. Rio is now a 3 year old pit-bull mix that I adopted when I was working at Robinhood. She is the sweetest girl you would ever meet and loves people. She'll like you to death if she had the chance (lol)

                    </li>
                    <li>When I met my now wife, she had a dog named Milo. He was a rescue just like Rio but was older (1 when my wife got him). We had Milo until we had to put him down in May (he was 4 and a half at the time)</li>
                    <li>In July my wife and I got a new dog named Bailey. She is a Heeler mix and is the sweetest thing you'll meet. She loves playing with her sister Rio and enjoys long walks where she can explore new areas

            <p>Sport History
                <ol>
                    <li class="Sports">Swimming
                        <p class="Swimming">I began swimming when I was very young (maybe 4 or 5 years old) with my grandparents.</p>
                        <p class="Swimming">I started of swimming when my grandmother took me to the pool and would let me jump into her arms (she would let me go under water for a bit then pick me up out of it)</p>
                        <p class="Swimming">We did this for hours on end. Eventually this led into me taking swim lessons and eventually joining a swim team during the summers when I spent the most time with my grandparents</p>
                        <p class="Swimming">Over the years of swimming during the summer I eventually had the chance to join my high schools swim team my freshman year</p>
                        <p class="Swimming">I was able to join my high schools team and became one of the top swimmers on the team and led our team to 4 years of being County Champions and 2 years going to state semi-finals. I was also named to the varsity team for all 4 years while in high school</p>
                        <p class="Swimming">When I left high school and went to Fairfield for college, I had the opportunity to join the swim team there as well</p>
                        <p class="Swimming">I walked onto my college team and swam for them for 2 years before I decided to stop swimming</p>
                        <p class="Swimming">Even though I stopped swimming competitively I still swim from time to time and have participated in a few events over the years for companies</p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="Sports">Golf
                        <p class="Golf">Just like all good stories this one starts off with a bit of a funny episode. My grandparents got me into all the sports I played and still play to this day (except for rock climbing). I was about 6 years old when I told my grandfather that I wanted to join him on the golf course and play with him</p>
                        <p class="Golf">Since I was very young my grandfather decided to put together a little test to see if I was ready to play. Now this test was setup to see if I could hit the ball without taking a giant hole out of the ground, which would destroy the course if I did that. My grandfather handed me a club and put a ball down in an open field and told me to hit the ball. I swung the club and hit the ball over the powerlines above and maybe 50ft infront of me. My grandfather couldn't believe his eyes, so he put a second ball down (thinking the first was a fluk), and I did the same thing for 4 more balls.</p>
                        <p class="Golf">After that my grandfather took me out and taught me how to play golf, not just hitting but how to read a green, the etique of the game, and how to act while on the course</p>
                        <p class="Golf">Just like swimming I wanted to join the golf team at my high school, which I did and played all 4 years and was varsity for 2 of them</p>
                        <p class="Golf">Unlike swimming I did not join my college's team but still played regularly with my uncle or aunt who did not live far from my school. I also met a few friends in college that I started to play with as well during the weekends and summers</p>
                        <p class="Golf">Today I play as often as I can (usually maybe once a weekend or at minimum once a month). This year has been a bit different than last years as I sustained an ankle injury that has kept me on the sideline since July.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="Sports">Skiing
                        <p class="Skiing">I started skiing when I was 6 years old. My aunt and grandparents taught me. My aunt would take me up the ski lift to the top, and the whole trip down the slope she would ski backwards holding onto me to make sure I didn't fall or go out of control. After having the basics of how to ski I joined the ski programs that my mountain had and became even better.</p>
                        <p class="Skiing">Throughout my younger and high school years I was part of a competitive ski team that specialized in mogul skiing. I competed a few times a year with my teammates and others from all over the NorthEast.</p>
                        <p class="Skiing">Due to injuries and swimming I stopped competing and went on to teach the same group of kids I used to ski with. I have taught some of the most talented kids and had the chance to work with some of the best (my bosses were former olympians for the sport).</p>
                        <p class="Skiing">Currently I no longer coach but would love to go back to coaching one of these days. Even though I no longer coach I still go up to Vermont to ski at least once a year during the Christmas holiday season to spend time with friends and family that are there.</p>

                    </li>
                    <li class="Sports">Rock Climbing
                        <p class="Climbing">I got into Rock Climbing via my roommates I lived with when I lived in Hoboken. I started climbing in 2018/2019 by going once a month with my roommates. I used to use their guest pass that they got with the membership they had and use the rentals that the gym offered. During the pandemic the gym shut down, but once it reopened I ended up buying a membership myself and started going more often. I eventually bought my own shoes, and other gear necessary for climbing. During this time I met some of my best friends that I go on climbing trips with and hangout with outside of climbing.</p>
                        <p class="Climbing">After climbing for about 3/4 years at this point I have accelerated my ability and have been able to complete climbs that I would have never been able to complete a year ago. Though most of my climbing currently has been inside the gyms we go to, we have gone on some amazing trips. Some of the trips we have gone on are, Tatcher State Park in NY (where the picture below is from) and Hanging Mountain in Massachusetts. Unfortunately in July I blew my ankle out while climbing and have been out since then. I am hoping that I am back up and ready to go before this coming summer so that we can go outdoors again soon.</p>
                        <p class="Climbing">The future for my climbing currently is unsure due to the injury I have right now. Though with a full recovery in the distance (hopefully), I plan on going to many new and adventurout places. Such places would be Yosemite National Park to climb El Capitan, Red River Gorge to climb in a different state, and anywhere else in the world that I can possible go to.</p>

                        <p class="football">My family has been an avid Giants family since my grandfathers fathers day</p>
                        <p class="football">In the old stadium our family seats were under the overhang on the first level. Though with the new stadium we are out in the open as you can see from the below image.</p>
                        <p class="football">My family has 2 seats per home game for the giants. I usually go to about 2 games a year; 1 with my aunt and 1 with my wife.</p>
