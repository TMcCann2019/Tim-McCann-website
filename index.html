            <p>Dog History
                <ol class="Dogs">
                    <li>My first dog I had was named Junie. She was a 1 year old pit-bull mix that I adopted with my significant other.</li>
                    <li>My second dog I got was named Rio. Rio is now a 3 year old pit-bull mix that I adopted when I was working at Robinhood. She is the sweetest girl you would ever meet and loves people. She'll like you to death if she had the chance (lol)

                    </li>
                    <li>When I met my now wife, she had a dog named Milo. He was a rescue just like Rio but was older (1 when my wife got him). We had Milo until we had to put him down in May (he was 4 and a half at the time)</li>
                    <li>In July my wife and I got a new dog named Bailey. She is a Heeler mix and is the sweetest thing you'll meet. She loves playing with her sister Rio and enjoys long walks where she can explore new areas
